**Task 1**
1. Draw the 3D structure of 3-methylpentanoic acid using Jmol Application. Do energy minimization. 
2. Label the atoms with numbers. 
3. Measure the bond distances between, C=O (double bond )and C-O (single bond).
4. Display the 3D structure in Sticks format.
5. Save the image as Mol file ( file extension .mol).
6. Export the image file as JPEG/PNG/PDF format. 



**Task 2**
1. Draw 3D structure of 2-phenylethylacetate using Jmol Application. Do energy minimization. 
2. Label all the atoms. 
3. Display the 3D structure in wireframe format. 
4. Change the size of the bonds to 0.10 Angstroms. 
5. Save the image as Mol file ( file extension .mol). 
6. Export the image file as JPEG/PNG/PDF format.
